# IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition using IBM's HR dataset. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide actionable insights to improve retention.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Data extraction & transformation
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard creation
- **Python** – Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains employee details, including:

- **Demographics** (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
- **Work-related factors** (Department, Job Role, Overtime, Salary Range, Years at Company)
- **Attrition Status** (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Key Insights

1️⃣ **237 employees left the company** – Understanding attrition volume.\
2️⃣ **Average attrition rate: 16.12%** – Employee turnover is moderate.\
3️⃣ **More men left than women** – Gender-wise attrition variation.\
4️⃣ **Overtime is linked to high attrition (30.55%)** – Excess workload affects retention.\
5️⃣ **Freshers have the third-highest attrition rate** – Early-career employees are leaving frequently.\
6️⃣ **Sales department has the highest attrition rate (20.6%)** – Job dissatisfaction in sales roles.\
7️⃣ **29% of employees who left earned under 3K, while high-income earners stayed** – Salary plays a key role in retention.

## 📌 Recommendations

✔ **Improve work-life balance in Sales** – Implement better policies to reduce stress.\
✔ **Increase salaries over time** – Competitive pay improves retention.\
✔ **Limit excessive overtime or provide extra pay** – Reducing workload can prevent burnout.\
✔ **Introduce fresher-friendly programs** – Better onboarding and mentorship can help retain young talent.
